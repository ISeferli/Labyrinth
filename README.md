# Labyrinth

This is a terminal-based labyrinth puzzle game written in **MIPS Assembly**, developed as part of a university project at **Technical University of Crete (TUC)**. The objective is simple: guide your player through a maze and reach the goal symbol `@` â€” but youâ€™ll need to avoid walls, plan your moves, or use the built-in solver.

## ðŸŽ® Game Description

This program simulates a player navigating a maze displayed with ASCII characters. You use keyboard inputs to move in four directions. Walls (`I`) block movement, and the goal is to reach the end marked by `@`. You can also press `E` to auto-solve the maze and see the optimal path.
